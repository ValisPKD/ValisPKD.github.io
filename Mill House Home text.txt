The Cats of Coeur d'Alene

While staying at the Mill House you may notice that there are a few furry friends that are lurking about. 
When I moved into my house a local mother cat had recently given birth. After a few unsuccessful 
attempts to have them rescued by animal services, I had to take matters into my own hands. I captured the cat
and took them to the vet where they received their vaccinations and were all spayed/neutered. At the 
advising of a vet I re-released the cats afterward and since then they have decided to call my house thier home.
Below is a list and some pictures of some of the cats that can be spotted while you stay at the Mill House. If you 
do happen to spot a cat, I ask that you admire from a distance for the saftey of you and the cat. 

Charcoal aka Mother
Charcoal is a black cat who initially showed up on the property a few years ago. She has short black hair and 
can be commonly seen haning around the roof of the Mill House. She is the mother to all of the other cats. 

Liso
Liso is a slim grey cat who is often adventerous and is willing to approach people. He is the leader of the pack
and will often play in plain view. If you find yourself out on the lounge chair, do not be suprised if he approaches to say hello.

Smokee
Smokee or Shmokes as we like to call him is a fluffy grey cat with a bent tail that adds some character. Schmokes is a bit 
timid and will often run away when confronted so if you do happen to see Schmokes, he is best admired from afar lest you scare 
him away and not have a chance to bask in the fluffiness. 

Bart 
Bart looks like Smokee if he got dipped in a drum full of black paint. Bart is the most adventerous of all of the cats and can often be 
spotted a few streets away haning out in other front yards and catching some rays on a sunny day. Bart is not easily intimidated
and may come to greet you at your front door (and may try to enter too)

Daughter
Daughter is commonly refered to as Mother/Daughter because from a distance it is hard to tell the two apart. Her behavior is also 
similar to her mother making it tough to write anything more.

There are also raccoons that can be spotted so if you see them, watch out.

From the beautiful lake and boardwalk to some truly amazing restaurants, be sure to take advantage of the town and 
all that it has to offer. Below I have included some of my favorite spots with a brief description of what makes them
so wonderful. Personal favorites are marked with a star, but if it's listed in the first place it's worth your time.

get your day started

visiting. An amazing fireplace at the center keeps it warm throughout the winter and a child's room below is the perfect place to 
take your kid if you are looking for some indoor fun. 
* Fort Sherman Playground - Anothing great place to take your kid, the Fort Sherman Playground is modeled after the actual Fort Sherman. 
The wooden playground is surrounded by fun facts and historical houses. Definitly worth a trip.

sweet treats are pretty amazing as well. Don't forget to grab a pecan cinnamon roll to go!

---About---
-About Your Host-
Ever since I was a child I knew that I wanted to spend my adult life in a small resort town with a little plot of land
to call my own. Luckily in 2008 that dream became a reality. After one vist on a vacation to Coeur d'Alene I knew that this was the place for me. The cozy 
town spoke to me and I made arrangements to move up immediatly. I spent years working in the local hotel as a hospitality consultant until 2015.

-About the Mill House-
In 2015, life was changing around me. The town of Couer d'Alene was beginning to boom and I was looking to try something new. The Mill House 
began as a shed that I had in my backyard for years and had always joked would be an adorable guest house. After a few months of serious
thought, I decided to take the leap and transform it into the little house it is today. Having worked in the hospitality business for over 30 years 
transforming it into the town's coziest stay was a challenge I was up for. Since then, I have had over 1,000 guests stay at the Mill House and have 
baked fresh cookies for each and every one. I hope to do the same for you when you book!
